### Our Innovative Idea  
Our idea is to create a cocktail/drink recipe guide social media hybrid.
### Important Components
1. Recipe Query
    - Users will be able to give a list of ingredients they have/like and be presented with a list of cocktails/drinks they can make.
    - Can retrive recipies that only include given ingredients, or recipies with those ingredients in them.
    - User generated guides/recipies will be included in this list (see point 2), ranked by popularity.
2. User Made Guides
    - Users will have profiles that include their guides, images of drinks they have and/or made, or other text posts.
    - Guides can be commented on, liked, shared and 'forked'.
    - 'Forked' guides are modifications to preexisting guides and are slight variations of such. 
        - This allows users to add their own personality to a guide.
        - Popular forked guides will be listed on the preexisting guide.
3. User Feeds
    - Users can 'follow' one another, thus being notified of content a user puts out.
    - Users will be reccomended guides based on previous liked guides
    - Supports ad integration, delivery method of such ($$)
